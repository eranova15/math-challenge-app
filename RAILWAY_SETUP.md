# Railway Deployment Setup Guide

## Current Status âœ…
- **Server**: Fixed and deployed with clean healthcheck endpoint
- **Package**: All dependencies synchronized  
- **Configuration**: Railway.json configured with proper healthcheck

## Next Steps (Complete these in Railway Dashboard)

### 1. Add Redis Database Service
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "Add Service" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Redis"
3. This will create a Redis instance and automatically set `REDIS_URL` environment variable
4. The server will automatically detect Redis and enable multiplayer features

### 2. Configure Stripe Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in Railway:
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_publishable_key  
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_endpoint_secret
STRIPE_BASIC_PRICE_ID=price_your_basic_plan_id
STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID=price_your_premium_plan_id
```

### 3. Set Production Environment Variables
```
NODE_ENV=production
CLIENT_URL=https://your-railway-domain.railway.app
```

### 4. Custom Domain Setup
1. In Railway dashboard, go to Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add custom domain: `thehypotheticalgame.com`
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. Update CLIENT_URL to: `https://thehypotheticalgame.com`

## Stripe Setup Required

### Create Products in Stripe Dashboard:
1. **Basic Plan**: $12/month
   - Features: Unlimited games, progress tracking, basic multiplayer
   
2. **Premium Family Plan**: $25/month  
   - Features: All basic + family accounts, AI difficulty, analytics

### Configure Webhook Endpoint:
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
- Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`

## Revenue Projections ðŸ’°

**Path to $10,000/month:**
- 400 Basic subscribers ($12 Ã— 400 = $4,800)
- 240 Premium subscribers ($25 Ã— 240 = $6,000)
- **Total: $10,800/month**

**Conservative Growth Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Launch, initial 10-20 subscribers
- Month 1: 50-100 subscribers ($600-2,500/month)
- Month 3: 200-300 subscribers ($2,400-7,500/month)
- Month 6: 400-600+ subscribers ($4,800-15,000+/month)

## Health Check Status
The server now properly responds to Railway health checks at `/health` endpoint:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T23:01:03.286Z", 
  "uptime": 123.0661235,
  "redis": false,
  "environment": "development",
  "message": "The Hypothetical Game Server is running"
}
```

Once Redis is added, `redis` will show `true` and multiplayer features will be enabled.
